# Arken DayZ Config Tool
Arken is a DayZ (Currently Config) Tool, made with Python, I created using AI (since Iam not a proper coder/programmer) and I really just wanted to test out the AI too see what I could create. All in all, the tool may seem useless to intermediate or seasoned modders but for beginners it may actually be helpful, who knows, feel free to try it and see if it helps you in some way. 
Arken DayZ Config Tool is mostly for terrain makers or asset creators but anyone can use it ofcourse.
The tool can provide you with a 'Simple Config' that simply allows you too pack a folder into a .pbo file where you don't have to specify anything specific in the config, like a simple config for packing your data folder that contains your layers etc.
We can then also create a normal config that has the class template setup ready for an asset that needs defining for use ingame. Classes will always be prefixed with Land_.

Make sure Browse Prefix has a valid path before using the Browse function.

# Arken Model.Cfg Editor
Still a work in progress and may take some time to get it into its finished state of the ideas I have.
*The Preview window is not fully functional!*
With the Model.Cfg Editor you can create one simple *AnimClass* for your model.cfg if for example you have a door you want animated for a house. You can create a base model.Cfg in the location you choose. Make Sure **Create Prefix** has a valid path, this is where the newly created base model.cfg gets saved.
Whatever the class is you want to edit with the editor, make sure the class is named *class AnimClass*
*P: is default for paths in Arken*
